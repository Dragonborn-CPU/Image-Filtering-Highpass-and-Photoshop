# Image-Filtering-Photoshop
Three different interfaces that process images through photoshop and displays them. The best interface to use is the GreatestInterface.py. The other programs were pre-tests for GreatestInterface.py and are very messy.

When using any of the interfaces, one problem that may arise is that whatever software you are using to run the program does not acquire all the python libraries necessary. The main libraries that softwares have trouble importing is:
1. mayavi
2. PyQt3D
3. opencv-python
4. pywin32
5. photoshop-python-api (https://github.com/lohriialo/photoshop-scripting-python)

You may have to manually install the libraries in your project interpreter.
